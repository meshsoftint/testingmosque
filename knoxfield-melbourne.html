If you're looking for a charming Victorian town to visit, Knoxfield is definitely worth a visit. The town is home to a number of historic buildings and is surrounded by beautiful countryside. The people are friendly and the town has a lot of character. Overall, I had a great time visiting Knoxfield and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing weekend getaway.
