                    <h2>The Process of Developing Software Applications</h2><p>Developing software applications is a complex process that involves several stages. The first step in the process is requirements gathering, which involves identifying and documenting the needs of the end-users. This stage helps to ensure that the final product meets the expectations of its intended users.<br/><br/>Once requirements have been gathered, design becomes an essential part of software engineering. During this phase, developers create a blueprint for how the application will look and function. They also determine what technologies will be used to build it and develop a plan for implementing those technologies effectively.<br/><br/>Testing is another critical aspect of software development as it ensures that all features work correctly before release. Developers use various testing methods such as unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing to identify any bugs or issues that may arise during usage by end-users. By thoroughly checking each feature's functionality before deployment, developers can guarantee their application's reliability and reduce support costs later on down the line.<br/><table>  <tr>    <th>Stage</th>    <th>Description</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Requirements Gathering</td>    <td>Identifying and documenting the needs of end-users to ensure that the final product meets their expectations.</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Design</td>    <td>Creating a blueprint for how the application will look and function, determining what technologies will be used to build it, and developing a plan for implementing those technologies effectively.</td></tr><br/>  	<tr><td>Testing</td><br/><br/>  	<td>Ensuring that all features work correctly before release by using various testing methods such as unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing.
