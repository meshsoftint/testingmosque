And if you're looking for a slower-paced lifestyle, Melbourne is the perfect place to visit. The city is home to a variety of shops, restaurants, and galleries, and it's a great place to relax and take in the sights and sounds of the city. <h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>
I'm really glad I got to visit Vermont and Melbourne! They're both beautiful places and I enjoyed spending time there. I'm looking forward to returning someday.
