                    <h2>Ø§ÙØªØ§Ø±ÙØ® Ø§ÙØ«ÙØ§ÙÙ ÙØ§ÙØ§Ø¬ØªÙØ§Ø¹Ù ÙÙÙØ§Ø·Ù Ø¨Ø§ÙØ³ØªØ§Ù</h2><p>The cultural and social history of Pakistan dates back thousands of years, where this region has been a center of civilization throughout its history. Pakistan has witnessed prosperity in different periods of history, starting from the Mohenjo Daro civilization to the Islamic rule in most parts of the region. History indicates that Muslims took control over a large part of Pakistan after the death of Prophet Muhammad.<br/><br/>The culture in Pakistan is rich and diverse, with some aspects resembling neighboring countries' cultures. They have an esteemed system called "Jirga" used to solve problems. These Sardars or Maliks meet to discuss social issues, and sometimes courts use this method to resolve disputes. Moreover, Pakistan is known for its traditional industries such as pottery, glass painting, carpet weaving, and traditional clothing.<br/><br/>In addition to that, the Sherpur area in Pakistan is home to the lush Deodar forests which are considered among the most beautiful natural landscapes in Hindu Kush Mountains. Also, Neelam Valley on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan boasts stunning beauty with rural villages woven into its rugged terrain - truly perplexing yet bursting with life!</p><h2>Ø§ÙØ§ÙØªØµØ§Ø¯ Ø§ÙØ¨Ø§ÙØ³ØªØ§ÙÙ ÙØªØ­Ø¯ÙØ§ØªÙ Ø§ÙØ­Ø§ÙÙØ©</h2><p>Pakistan, a developing nation facing insurmountable challenges in the economic sphere, grapples with high levels of poverty and unemployment. The current state of Pakistan's economy is plagued by a weak banking sector suffering from mismanagement that stunts business growth and hinders job opportunities.<br/><br/>Adding to this already perplexing situation, Pakistan witnesses a decline in exports of clothing, carpets and other products whilst experiencing partial roadblocks due to inadequate infrastructure in some cities which restricts capital inflow.<br/><br/>However, hope rises anew as the sun shines on Pakistan's economy through the utilization of "CPEC" (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) system extracts. CPEC is an infrastructure development project connecting Pakistan and China involving billions of dollars invested in building roads, railways and ports. This project will ease exportation from Pakistan to foreign markets while providing material enhancements for its economy.</p><h2>Ø§ÙÙÙØ§Ø¸Ø± Ø§ÙØ·Ø¨ÙØ¹ÙØ© Ø§ÙØ®ÙØ§Ø¨Ø© ÙÙ Ø¨Ø§ÙØ³ØªØ§Ù</h2><p>Pakistan boasts stunning natural landscapes that leave tourists from all over the world in awe. The majestic mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas and Karakoram, give an enchanting vibe to the scenery. There are also breathtaking rivers in Pakistan like Indus and Swat rivers that have transformed meadows into luscious green belts.<br/><br/>Some venture out to take a deep breath of fresh air amidst these mountains. However, visiting Thar Desert in Pakistan can be overwhelming due to its unique features that are enough to intimidate anyone.<br/><br/>Gilgit city adds cultural and historical significance to Pakistan with ancient castles and walls made of stone. It is said that this city was once used for trade between Indian subcontinent and Central Asia, making it a point of collision between multiple civilizations.</p><h2>Ø§ÙØ£Ø¯ÙØ§Ù ÙØ§ÙØªØ¹Ø¯Ø¯ÙØ© Ø§ÙØ«ÙØ§ÙÙØ© ÙÙ Ø¨Ø§ÙØ³ØªØ§Ù</h2><p>Pakistan is a land of perplexing religious diversity, where faith bursts forth from every corner in a vibrant tapestry of traditions. Islam reigns supreme as the predominant religion, owing to the overwhelming majority of its inhabitants being Muslim. However, Pakistan also boasts an eclectic mix of other religions and sects including Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism. It's remarkable how all these religions share common shrines and tombs such as Lahore's tomb belonging to "Lahore", Tarbel Fields belonging to "Suhayb" and Abdul Qadir Jilani's tomb belonging to "Karatha".<br/><br/>The country celebrates its unique identity through a bursty melange of religious beliefs that are passionately defended by their followers. They come together in harmony with each otherâs customs while rejoicing in their respective heritage. The constitution of Pakistan guarantees freedom for all religions, promoting interfaith harmony and tolerance.<br/><br/>Pakistan is home to several religious minorities like Christians, Hindus, Buddhists among others which exhibit unique cultural authenticity. These minorities emphasize on inter-faith interaction across all fields especially evident in Pakistani cuisine where Muslims and non-Muslims alike use similar ingredients while celebrating shared heritage.</p><h2>Ø§ÙØ£Ø·Ø¨Ø§Ù Ø§ÙØ´ÙÙØ© ÙØ§ÙÙØ£ÙÙÙØ§Øª Ø§ÙØ´Ø¹Ø¨ÙØ© ÙÙ Ø¨Ø§ÙØ³ØªØ§Ù</h2><p>The Pakistani cuisine is renowned for its diversity and richness in flavors. A vast array of spices and herbs are employed to create the most tantalizing dishes. The Pakistanis have a predilection towards East Asian delicacies like "Biryani," which is a delectable concoction of rice, chicken or mutton, and "Sourry," an exotic dish comprising succulent pieces of shredded meat swimming in water.<br/><br/>Moreover, the ubiquitous "Dalla Soup" has become a staple food item in Pakistan. It's prepared by boiling tiny amusing pulses (lentils) in black vessels - often infused with chili peppers - that could be valued up to 10,000 degrees on the Scoville scale.<br/><br/>The travel buffs prefer not to swap their traditional favorite "Chakpamal" (rice cooked with milk), as it's served at most Easter festivities. Also, "Sajji" is another popular main course dish relished throughout Pakistan; it consists of massive chunks of charcoal-grilled lamb or chicken that will leave you wanting more!</p>
